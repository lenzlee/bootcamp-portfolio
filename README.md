Bootcamp Homework 2: Portfolio (Advanced CSS)

## My Portfolio

In this project, we built our first web application from scratch. We were asked to create our portfolio site which we can build on as our course progresses. In this specific task, we showcased some core skills using advance CSS (flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables).

## Page Contents

My page includes a **header with navigation links** to: About Me, Technical Toolbox, My Projects, and Contact Me. The page will scroll to the corresponding sections when each of the nav links are clicked.

My page also has a **hero image with a caption** which displays full width. It is also set to disappear when viewports are between 320px and 480px wide.

In the **About Me section**, I have my description display on the left and my profile photo displaying on the right column. 

The **Technical Toolbox section** lists all of my current technical knowledge and skills.

The **My Projects section** contains placeholder contents for now. I will replace this section with real examples as we go further along in this course. The first image will display a modal pop up when clicked. This is how I plan to set up all items in this section. I used inline JS for this section for now. I am still learning JavaScript, so I am hoping my code will improve over time. 

The **Contact Me section** simply lists my e-mail address and a placeholder info for phone number. I am planning on adding an embedded contact form in this section in the future.

Lastly, the **footer section** just has a standard copyright and disclaimer placeholder for now.

## Resources Used

In this project, I used our class lessons for reference. I also used W3 schools for the Modal function for the My Projects section. For media queries, I referenced CSS Tricks. Lastly, I borrowed the Chicago Bean Sculpture photo from Google Images.
