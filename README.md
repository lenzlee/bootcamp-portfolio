# Module 2: Advanced CSS Challenge

## My Portfolio

In this project, we built our first web application from scratch. We were asked to create our portfolio site which we can build on as our course progresses. In this specific task, we showcased some core skills using advance CSS (flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables).

## Page Contents

My page includes a **header with navigation links** to: About Me, Technical Toolbox, My Projects, and Contact Me. The page will scroll to the corresponding sections when each of the nav links are clicked.

My page also has a **hero image with a caption** which displays full width. It is also set to disappear when viewports are between 320px and 480px wide.

In the **About Me section**, I have my description display on the left and my profile photo displaying on the right column. 

The **Technical Toolbox section** lists all of my current technical knowledge and skills.

The **My Projects section** contains a listing of projects we worked on for this course. when you click on each project, a modal window will open with project details and a view website link which will then take you to the deployed application. 

The **Contact Me section** simply lists my e-mail address and a placeholder info for phone number. 

Lastly, the **footer section** just has a standard copyright and disclaimer placeholder for now.

## Resources/References:

I mostly referred to our HTML, CSS, and Javascript lessons/activities for this assignment.

**Bootstrap 5.0:** (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/)

**JQuery package:** (https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js)

I also used W3 schools for the Modal function for the My Projects section. 

For media queries, I referenced CSS Tricks. 

Lastly, I borrowed the Chicago Bean Sculpture photo from Google Images.
